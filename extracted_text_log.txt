Extracted Text at 3427.5s: Collaboration

Definition 2.1. Collaboration (or cooperation) is the process of groups of
agents acting together for common, mutual benefit, as opposed to acting in
competition for selfish benefit. In a collaboration, every agent contributes to the
common goal and benefits from the contributions of others.

In learning situations, the benefit is “better learning”.

Observation: In collaborative learning, the overall result can be significantly
better than in competitive learning.

Good Practice: Form study groups. (long- or short-term)

1. AX those learners who work most, learn most!
2. AX freeloaders — individuals who only watch — learn very little!

P It is OK to collaborate on homework assignments in Al-1! (no bonus points)
P Choose your study group well! (We will (eventually) help via ALeA)

> Note: There are two ways of learning: (both are OK, your mileage may vary)

> Approach B: Read a book/papers (here: lecture notes)
> Approach |: come to the lectures, be involved, interrupt the instructor whenever you
have a question.

The only advantage of | over B is that books/papers do not answer questions

> Approach S: come to the lectures and sleep does not work!

>

Definition 3.21. A large language model (LLM) is a computational model
capable of language generation or other natural language processing tasks.

Example 3.22. OpenAl's GPT, Google’s Bard, and Meta’s Llama.
Definition 3.23. A chatbot is a software application or web interface that is

designed to mimic human conversation through text or voice interactions.
Modern chatbots are usually based on LLMs.

Example 3.24 (ChatGPT talks about Al-1). (but remains vague)
Example 3.25 (In the Al-1 exam). ChatGPT scores ca. 50% of the points.

> ChatGPT can almost pass the exam ... (We could award it a Master's degree)
> But can you? (the Al-1 exams will be in person on paper)
You will only pass the exam, if you can do Al-1 yourself!

Intuition: Al tools like GhatGPT, CoPilot, etc. (see also [She24])
> can help you solve problems, (valuable tools in production situations)
P hinders learning if used for homeworks/quizzes, etc. (like driving instead of jogging)
What (not) to do: (to get most of the brave new Al-supported world)

> try out these tools to get a first-hand intuition what they can/cannot do
> challenge yourself while learning so that you can also do it (mind over matter!)

A literal is an atomic formula or a negation of one. A formula is said to be in
. negation normal form (NNF), iff negations are litcrals.
. conjunctive normal form (CNF), iff it is a conjunction of disjunctions of
literals.

disjunctive normal form (DNF), iff it is a disjunction of conjunctions of
literals.

A sequence of actions is a solution

It could equivalently be defined as a sequence of
actions: we can compute the state sequence from the

action sequence and - given the initial state - the
action sequence from the state sequence.

> Another Consequence: Al as a field is an incubator for many innovative
technologies.

> Al Conundrum: Once Al solves a subfield it is called “computer science”.
(becomes a separate subfield of CS)

> Example 2.1. Functional/Logic Programming, automated theorem proving,
Planning, machine learning, Knowledge Representation, ...

Definition 3.21. A large language model (LLM) is a computational model
capable of language generation or other natural language processing tasks.

Example 3.22. OpenAl's GPT, Google’s Bard, and Meta’s Llama.
Definition 3.23. A chatbot is a software application or web interface that is

designed to mimic human conversation through text or voice interactions.
Modern chatbots are usually based on LLMs.

Example 3.24 (ChatGPT talks about Al-1). (but remains vague)
Example 3.25 (In the Al-1 exam). ChatGPT scores ca. 50% of the points.

> ChatGPT can almost pass the exam ... (We could award it a Master's degree)
> But can you? (the Al-1 exams will be in person on paper)
You will only pass the exam, if you can do Al-1 yourself!

Intuition: Al tools like GhatGPT, CoPilot, etc. (see also [She24])
> can help you solve problems, (valuable tools in production situations)
P hinders learning if used for homeworks/quizzes, etc. (like driving instead of jogging)
What (not) to do: (to get most of the brave new Al-supported world)

> try out these tools to get a first-hand intuition what they can/cannot do
> challenge yourself while learning so that you can also do it (mind over matter!)

[> Definition 1.1.11. Let JZ be a problem with states S. A heuristic function (or

whenever s is a goal state.

e.

Definition 0.1. A search problem (S,.4,7,7,9) consists of a set 5 of states, a set 4 of actions, and a EB
transition model 7: A x S — P(S) that assigns to any action a € 4 and state s € 5 a set of successor }
states,

at Certain states in 5 are designated as goal states (9 C 5) and initial states 7 C S. ya goal

A literal is an atomic formula or a negation of one. A formula is said to be in
. negation normal form (NNF), iff negations are litcrals.
. conjunctive normal form (CNF), iff it is a conjunction of disjunctions of
literals.

disjunctive normal form (DNF), iff it is a disjunction of conjunctions of
literals.

A sequence of actions is a solution

It could equivalently be defined as a sequence of
actions: we can compute the state sequence from the

action sequence and - given the initial state - the
action sequence from the state sequence.

Solution: Initialize your learner model with your educational history!

> Concretely: enter taken CS courses (FAU equivalents) and grades.
> ALeA uses that to estimate your CS/Al competencies (for your benefit)

grab!

> But: researchers at the Dartmouth Conference (1956) really thought they
would solve/reach Al in two/three decades.

> Consequence: A\ still asks the big questions.

> Another Consequence: Al as a field is an incubator for many innovative
technologies.

> Al Conundrum: Once Al solves a subfield it is called “computer science”.
(becomes a separate subfield of CS)

> Example 2.1. Functional/Logic Programming, automated theorem proving,
Planning, machine learning, Knowledge Representation, ...

> Still Consequence: Al research was alternatingly flooded with money and cut
off brutally.

Definition 3.21. A large language model (LLM) is a computational model
capable of language generation or other natural language processing tasks.

Example 3.22. OpenAl's GPT, Google’s Bard, and Meta’s Llama.
Definition 3.23. A chatbot is a software application or web interface that is

designed to mimic human conversation through text or voice interactions.
Modern chatbots are usually based on LLMs.

Example 3.24 (ChatGPT talks about Al-1). (but remains vague)
Example 3.25 (In the Al-1 exam). ChatGPT scores ca. 50% of the points.

> ChatGPT can almost pass the exam ... (We could award it a Master's degree)
> But can you? (the Al-1 exams will be in person on paper)
You will only pass the exam, if you can do Al-1 yourself!

Intuition: Al tools like GhatGPT, CoPilot, etc. (see also [She24])
> can help you solve problems, (valuable tools in production situations)
P hinders learning if used for homeworks/quizzes, etc. (like driving instead of jogging)
What (not) to do: (to get most of the brave new Al-supported world)

> try out these tools to get a first-hand intuition what they can/cannot do
> challenge yourself while learning so that you can also do it (mind over matter!)

A literal is an atomic formula or a negation of one. A formula is said to be in
. negation normal form (NNF), iff negations are litcrals.
. conjunctive normal form (CNF), iff it is a conjunction of disjunctions of
literals.

disjunctive normal form (DNF), iff it is a disjunction of conjunctions of
literals.

A sequence of actions is a solution

It could equivalently be defined as a sequence of
actions: we can compute the state sequence from the

action sequence and - given the initial state - the
action sequence from the state sequence.
