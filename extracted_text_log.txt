P update the ALeA learner model
> The prepquiz will be given in the ALeA system

https: //courses.voll-ki.fau.de/quiz-dash/ai-1

You have to be logged into ALeA! (via FAU IDM)
You can take the prepquiz on your laptop or phone, ...

...in the lecture or at home ...

... via WLAN or 4G Network. (do not overload)
Prepquizzes will only be available 16:15-16:25!

Extracted Text at 3427.5s: Collaboration

Definition 2.1. Collaboration (or cooperation) is the process of groups of
agents acting together for common, mutual benefit, as opposed to acting in
competition for selfish benefit. In a collaboration, every agent contributes to the
common goal and benefits from the contributions of others.

In learning situations, the benefit is “better learning”.

Observation: In collaborative learning, the overall result can be significantly
better than in competitive learning.

Good Practice: Form study groups. (long- or short-term)

1. AX those learners who work most, learn most!
2. AX freeloaders — individuals who only watch — learn very little!

P It is OK to collaborate on homework assignments in Al-1! (no bonus points)
P Choose your study group well! (We will (eventually) help via ALeA)

> Note: There are two ways of learning: (both are OK, your mileage may vary)

> Approach B: Read a book/papers (here: lecture notes)
> Approach |: come to the lectures, be involved, interrupt the instructor whenever you
have a question.

The only advantage of | over B is that books/papers do not answer questions

> Approach S: come to the lectures and sleep does not work!
